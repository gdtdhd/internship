# SkillCraft Technology Internship – Machine Learning Task Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio for the **SkillCraft Technology Machine Learning Internship**. This repository is a structured collection of tasks designed to demonstrate core concepts in Machine Learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). Each task reflects real-world applications and has been implemented using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

All tasks are developed independently, and each project focuses on different ML domains such as predictive analytics, clustering, computer vision, and text-based sentiment analysis. The goal is to build, train, evaluate, and interpret models that solve meaningful problems using practical datasets.

## Repository Structure

Each task is maintained in its own dedicated subdirectory and GitHub repository, following the naming convention:  
**SCT_ML_Task1**, **SCT_ML_Task2**, **SCT_ML_Task3**, and **SCT_ML_Task4**

This modularity ensures clean separation of concerns, version control clarity, and better maintainability.
